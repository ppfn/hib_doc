###   Command INTCRS


------------------------------


The command INTCRS allows you  to determine (and print out) integral cross

sections (in units of square Angstroms) from a previously calculated set of  S  matrices which have been

written to file  [file](files.html)

{jobname}n.smt .

The command line

syntax is


INTCRS,{jobname},ienerg


where

{jobnam}:   the jobname under which the  S  matrices

have been stored as  {jobname}n.smt .  Here  n  denotes the

value of the parameter ienerg (see below).   S -matrix (.smt) files can be generated by setting

the flag  [WRSMAT](prsmat.html)   = .true.  The default value

of  {jobnam}  is the value of the jobname you have set with

the instruction   JOB ={jobname}


![](cautionsmall.gif)  Note that for full close-coupling determinations of integral cross sections

the previous  calculations of the  S  matrices must have been done for both values

of the parity index   [JLPAR](jlpar.html)

(this is ensured by setting   [JLPAR](jlpar.html)  =0 ;

see the  [JLPAR](jlpar.html)   frame for more information)

If no value has been set, the

default value of

{jobname}  is  Job


ienerg:   The cardinal value of the energy for which the integral cross

sections are to be computed.  i.e.  if  ienerg  = 2, then the

second energy  S  matrix file  {jobname}2.smt  is used.  The

default value of inerg is 1


The calculated integral cross sections are printed out in file  {jobname}{ienerg}.xxsc
