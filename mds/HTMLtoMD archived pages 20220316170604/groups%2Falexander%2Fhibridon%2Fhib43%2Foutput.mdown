###   Main Output File and Variable OUTPT


------------------------------


The Hibridon code writes all output, except for the specialized files

discussed in the in the  [JOB](files.html)   help entry, to a main output file (fortran

logical unit 9, a sequential formatted file).  In addition some output is

directed to  stdout  (fortran logical unit 6).  The name of the main output

file is initally set to  Outpt .  This name can be changed by resetting

the variable OUT, as follows:


OUT={outname},


where  {outname}  is a character string (not in quotes).  This name

is converted internally to lower case, with the first character upper case.


![](warningsmall.gif)  On some machines existing output files will be overwritten unless

you give them a new name.
