###   Parameters NUMIN and NUMAX


------------------------------


For  [Coupled States](coupledstates.html)

calculations the parameters NUMIN and NUMAX designate the minimum and maximum

value of the projection index  nu .  For collisions involving molecules with

half-integer spin, the minimum and maximum value of  nu  is equal to NUMIN+1/2 and

NUMAX+1/2.  If you

are interested in cross sections out of or into a level with rotational

quantum number  j , you must set NUMAX at least equal to  j .


NUMIN should be a positive number (or zero), since the CS  S  matrices

for negative  nu  can be related to those for positive  nu  by symmetry and

thus need not be computed.  If you set NUMIN=0, then you will compute

correctly cross sections for all  j -  j'  transitions with  j  and  j'  less

than or equal to NUMAX.


For

[Close Coupled](closecoupled.html)


calculations the parameters NUMIN and NUMAX can be given any values, but are then  set

internally to 0.
