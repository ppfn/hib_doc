###   Command OPTIMIZE


------------------------------


The OPTIMIZE command allows the user to determine easily optimal values

for the following system independent  [parameters](params.html)   which govern the accuracy of

the Hibridon code:


[FSTFAC](fstfac.html)  ,

[RCUT](rcut.html)  ,  [RENDAI](rendld.html)  ,

[RENDLD](rendld.html)  ,  [RINCR](tolai.html)  ,  [RSTART](rendld.html)  ,

[SPAC](spac.html)  ,  [TOLAI](tolai.html)


The command line syntax is


OPTIMIZE,{pname},IVAL,FVAL,FACT,STEP,ACCAV,ACCMX,THRESH


(upper or lower case), where


{pname}:         Name of the parameter from the above list which is to be varied


IVAL:

Initial value of this parameter


FVAL:           Final value of this parameter


FACT,STEP:      Variables which control the step size for the optimization.

The value of the parameter PNAME is updated at each step

following the equation


new value = (old value) * FACT + STEP


ACCAV, ACCMAX,

THRESH:

The optimization is stopped when, for two subsequent runs,

both the average

percentage difference between the  S  matrices (or the moduli

of the  S matrices)  is smaller than

ACCAV and the maximum percentage difference between the

S  matrices (or between the moduli of the  S matrices) is

smaller than ACCMAX. In this comparison all  S -matrix

elements of magnitude less than THRESH are neglected.  If THRESH

is positive, or zero, then the comparison involves the

moduli of the  S -matrix elements.  If THRESH is negative, then

the comparison involves both the real and imaginary parts of

the  S  matrix.


The optimization is performed only for  J tot   =  [JTOT1](jtot1.html)


Values for  {pname}, IVAL,  and  FVAL  must be given.  If values

for the other variables

are omitted ( see below ), then default values are assigned as follows:


ACCAV = 1
ACCMAX = 5
THRESH = 1.E-5


If FACT and STEP are not defined, then FACT is set equal to

2,

if FVAL

IVAL


0.5, if FVAL

![](warningsmall.gif)  Values of the various input

parameters may be omitted, but their place must be preserved by commas if

any of the subsequent parameters are to be given values other than their

default values.
