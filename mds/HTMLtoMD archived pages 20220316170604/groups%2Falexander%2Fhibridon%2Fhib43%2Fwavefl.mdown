wavefl


###   Flag WAVEFL


------------------------------


If WAVEFL = .TRUE., then the transformation matrices are computed

for the subsequent determination of the scattering wavefunction.  These

are written (in binary) to the file  {jobname}.wfu


Subsequent calculation of the

wavefunction is invoked by the command  [PSI](psi.html)  .

Subsequent calculation of the

incoming and outgoing fluxes is controlled by the command  [FLUX](flux.html)  .

The total storage required to store the transformation matrix is


( N log   + 2  N airy  )  x   N ch   2

+ 3  N airy    x   N ch  ,

where  N log   and  N airy   are the number of LODG and AIRY integration steps and

N ch   is the number of channels.  Thus the file  {jobname}.wfu


can often be very large.
