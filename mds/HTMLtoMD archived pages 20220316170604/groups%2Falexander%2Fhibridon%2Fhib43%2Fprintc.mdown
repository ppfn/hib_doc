###   Command PRINTC


------------------------------


The command PRINTC allows you to print out a subset of previously

calculated integral cross sections (in units of square Angstroms) which have been written to  [file](files.html)

{jobname}n.ics .  The subset of integral cross sections which will be printed

corresponds to all transitions out of levels for which the rotational

quantum number is specified in the array  [JOUT](jout.html)   and for which the

additional quantum index is specified in the array  [INDOUT](indout.html)  . The command line

syntax is


PRINTC,{jobname},iprint,iaver,ienerg


where

{jobnam}:   the jobname under which the integral cross sections

have been stored as  {jobname}n.ics .  Here  n  denotes the

value of the parameter ienerg (see below).  Integral

cross section (.ics) files can be generated by setting

the flag  [WRXSEC](prxsec.html)   = .true.  The default value

of  {jobnam}  is the value of the jobname you have set with

the instruction   JOB ={jobname}

Note that for full close-coupling determinations of integral cross sections

it is necessary to carry out calculations

for both values of this parity (this is ensured by setting   [JLPAR](jlpar.html)  =0 ;

see the  [JLPAR](jlpar.html)   frame for more information)


If no value of  {jobnam} has been set, the

default value of

{jobname}  is  Job


iprint:

iprint  {jobname}n.xsc


iprint .ge. 0, if the subset of desired integral cross sections is also

to be printed to the main  [output](output.html)   file


iprint   0, if the list of channel energies is also to be printed to the

main  [output](output.html)   file.


The default value of iprint is 0


iaver:    iaver = 0 if the full matrix of integral cross sections is to be

printed.


iaver = 1 if the integral cross sections are to be summed over

positive and negative values of the additional quantum

index of the final state


iaver = 2 if the integral cross sections are to be summed and

averaged over positive and negative values of the

additional quantum index of the initial and final states


![](cautionsmall.gif)  this summing and averaging is sure to work only if

there is an even number of open levels with alternating

values (positive and negative) of the quantum index


The default value of iaver is 0


ienerg:   The cardinal value of the energy for which the integral cross

sections are to be computed.  i.e.  if ienerg = 2, then the

second energy  S  matrix file  {jobname}2.smt  or second energy

integral cross section file  {jobname}2.ics  are used.  The

default value of inerg is 1
