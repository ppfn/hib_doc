hypxsc


###   Command HYPXSC


------------------------------


The command HYPXSC allows you to calculate  hyperfine-resolved integral cross


These integral cross sections are printed in the terminal output and outputted


to the file


{jobname}n.hfx , where  n  is the cardinal value of the energy (see below).  The hyperfine-resolved


cross sections are tabulated in columns as


E j i  IS i  F i  j f  IS f  F f  sigma


The command line syntax is


HYPXSC,{jobname},ienerg,nucspin,j1min,j2max


where


{jobnam}:   the jobname under which the S-matrices have been stored as  {jobname}n.smt .


Here  n  denotes the


value of the parameter  ienerg  (see below).


The S-matrix files can be generated


by setting the flag  [WRSMAT](wrsmat.html)    = .true.  The default value


of  {jobnam}  is set by the instruction   JOB ={jobname}

Note that for full close-coupling calculations


it is necessary to carry out calculations


for both values of the parity (this is ensured by setting   [JLPAR](jlpar.html)  =0 ;


see the  [JLPAR](jlpar.html)   page for more information)


If no value of  {jobnam} has been set, the


default value of


{jobname}  is  Job


ienerg:   The cardinal value of the energy for which the integral cross


sections are to be computed.  i. e.  if ienerg = 2, then the


second energy  S  matrix file  {jobname}2.smt  or second energy


integral cross section file  {jobname}2.ics  are used.  The


default value of inerg is 1


nucspin:  The value denoting  the total nuclear spin I of the diatomic,


nucspin=2*I  (0 for I=0, 1 for I=1/2, 2 for I=1 etc)


j1min:  Minimum value of the rotational angular momentum for which hyperfine cross sections will be calculated.


j2max:  Maximum value of the rotational angular momentum for which hyperfine cross sections will be calculated.
