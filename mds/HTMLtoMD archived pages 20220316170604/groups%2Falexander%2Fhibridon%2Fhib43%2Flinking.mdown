###   Linking an Executable (the  makehib  command)


------------------------------


To link an executable module you must execute the command


makehib [-b -d -c] {potname} [kmax]


where

{potname}  is the name of the  [potential](potlist.html)   subroutine  pot_{potname}.f , which

describes the system under investigation and which must be located in the Hibridon subdirectory  src/pot


kmax  is the numerical value of the maximum number of channels.  If this field is

omitted, a default value of  kmax = 151  is used.   ![](warningsmall.gif)  On Intel X86

platforms, to link and run jobs with kmax greater than 3941, you must change the  FI64  line

in the  [CONFIG](config.html)     file to read:


FI64="-mcmodel=medium -shared-intel"


-b  (optional) forces creation of a code requires fewer matrices and can thus

handle larger number of channels (for more details follow the  ["Memory Requirements"](memory.html)   link)


-d  (optional) forces creation of a code in which the   [potential](potlist.html)   subroutine  pot_{potname}.f  is compiled with the debug (f77 -g) option.


-c  (optional) forces creation of a code in which direct access I/O is handled by

C rather than FORTRAN routines.


the  makehib  command creates an executable module  bin/progs/hib_{potname}_kmax .


If the  -b  or  -d   -f  options (or both) are present, the

executable module is named, respectively,


hibb_{potname}_kmax


hibd_{potname}_kmax


hibc_{potname}_kmax


hibbd_{potname}_kmax

and so forth


The  file  h_{potname}.log  contains a log of this link, which may be examined in

case of failure.


------------------------------
For example,


makehib arno 251


will create an executable module  bin/progs/hib_arno_251


Here is the terminal output from this command


potname is arn2

current directory is /Users/mha/hib43/bin/progs

compiling pot subroutine for hib_arn2_151 ...

potname is pot_arn2.f

examine /Users/mha/hib43/h_arn2.log for diagnostic and/or error messages


![](warning.gif)  Your link will be unsuccessful unless all the requisite  .o  and  common  files have been previously created.  See the  [installation](install.html)

instructions.
