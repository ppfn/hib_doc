###   The Treatment of Bound States


------------------------------


####  Introduction


------------------------------


In an entirely equivalent manner to the description of molecular collisions,

one can make a   [Close-Coupled (CC)](closecoupled.html) (CC)  expansion for wavefunctions of bound states of weakly bound

complexes.  For more detail we refer the reader to an excellent review by Hutson.[1]

The  wavefunction of the complex

is expanded in a complete set of internal states of the system, usually constructed

as direct products of the internal states of one (or both) fragments, multiplied by

angular functions which describe the rotation of one collision partner about the other.

As in the  [CC](closecoupled.html)   description of scattering we designate these internal

states as  ![](phi12.gif) (  r  ),

where   r   designates the internal coordinates.  Each internal state is called

a  channel .

The full  wavefunction of the complex

is written as


![](psi12.gif) (  R  ,   r  ) =  ![](sigma18.gif)   F

(  R  )  x   ![](phi12.gif) (  r  )  (1)


The  n th   column of the  F (  R  ) matrix defines

the expansion coefficients for the  n th   bound state.


Substitution of  expansion (1) into the Schrödinger equation, premultiplication by one of the

internal states, and integration over   r   gives rise to a set of coupled

ordinary differential equations for the expansion coefficients  F

(  R  ), which are  identical  to the  [CC](closecoupled.html)

description of molecular scattering.


The general structure of these coupled second-order

differential equations is expressed by the matrix equation


[ 1   ![](partialderiv12.gif)  2 / ![](partialderiv12.gif)

R  2   +  W ( R )]  F ( R ) = 0 .

(2)


Here  1  designates the identity matrix,  R  is the interparticle

distance, and the matrix  W ( R ) is given by


W ( R ) =   k   2  -   l   2  - (2  m / h  2  )  V ( R ),

(3)


where  h  designates Planck's constant divided by 2 ![](pi12.gif) ,  m  is the reduced mass

of the collision system and   k   2  and   l   2   designate, respectively, the

(diagonal) matrices of the wavevector and the relative orbital angular

momentum of the collision partners. We have


(  k   2 )  ii   = (2  m / h  2  ) ( E - e i  ) ,

(4)


where  E  is the total energy and  e i   is the internal energy of the  i th

channel.  Also, we have


( l  2 )  ii   = ( h  2 /2  mR  2 )  l i   ( l   i   + 1) ,

(5)


where  l i   is the relative orbital angular momentum in the  i th   channel.

In

Eq. (3) the matrix  V ( R ) is the (full, symmetric) matrix of the coupling

potential.


Diagonalization of the  W ( R ) matrix yields the

diagonal matrix of  adiabatic wavevectors   k (R) .  The

eigenvectors define the locally adiabatic

states, which are transformations of the internal

states used to expand the scattering wavefunction,  ![](phi12.gif) (  r  ).

If  C  (R)  designates the matrix of eigenvectors, column

ordered, then the diagonal matrix of adiabatic energies is defined as


e (R)  =

C  (R)  T   V  (R)   C  (R)  .

Energies and Wavefuntions


------------------------------


In the  adiabatic bender  treatment of bound states,[2,3] these adiabatic energies define

a set of one-dimensional potentials in  R .  The wavefunctions and energies of these

one-dimensional potentials can be obtained by any standard numerical integration technique, such

as the Numerov method.[4]  These wavefunctions are the adiabatic-bender approximations to the

full wavefunctions of the bend-stretch states of the complex.


Alternatively, the energies and wavefunctions can be obtained by a dual numerical propagation of the

the matrix of solutions  F ( R ).  Propagation is outward

from a value of the interparticle distance  R = R start  , which

lies well inside the innermost classical turning point, and inward from  R = R end  , which

lies well outside the outermost classical turning point.  The outwardly and inwardly propagated

solution matrices are matched at a distance  R = R match  .  Only at the allowed

energies of the system will you be able to match, without discontinuity,

both the wavefunction and its first derivative.


Great numerical stability is obtained

by propagation of the logarithmic derivative of the solution matrix  F ( R ),

namely


Y ( R ) =  F ´( R ) F ( R ) -

1   (7)


rather than the solution matrix itself.  The matching condition is [5]


|  Y   o  ( R match , E ) -

Y   i  (  match ,

E ) | = 0 ,  (8)


where the subscripts  o  and  i  designate, respectively, the logderivative matrices at  R = R match

obtained from the outward and inward propagations.  A good initial estimate of the roots of the

determinant in Eq. (8) can be obtained from a prior adiabatic bender calculation.


Equivalently, the energies and wavefunctions can be obtained variationally.  Here, each element of the

solution matrix,  F i,j (R) , is expanded in terms of a set of functions

![](boundexpans.gif)  .  (9)


As in any standard linear variational technique, the energy and eigenfunction of the

n th

bound state is obtained by diagonalization of the matrix of the full Hamiltonian


H ( R ) =  1   ![](partialderiv12.gif)  2 / ![](partialderiv12.gif)

R  2   +  W ( R )  (10)


in the  ![](chibold12.gif)  (R)  basis.  The dimensions of this Hamiltonian

matrix are  M  x  N ch  , where  M  is the dimensionality of the  ![](chibold12.gif)  (R)  basis

and  N ch   is the number of internal states (channels). In the present implementation

within Hibridon  TM   code, the distributed Gaussian basis of Hamilton

and Light[6] is used, in which

Coupled States Approximation


Similarly to the treatment of molecular scattering, the  [Coupled-States](coupledstates.html)   approximation can be

made for bound states.  (This is sometimes called the  centrifugal decoupling  (CD)

approximation [1]).  Here, the energies and eigenfunctions refer to a system in which the

projection of the total angular momentum along    R   is assumed to be conserved, so that

this projection is a good quantum number.


------------------------------


The Hibridon code will calculate  bound-state energies if the flag   [BOUNDC](bound.html)

is set  .TRUE.

Another, powerful program package

for the solution of the close-coupled equations for bound states is the

[BOUND](http://www.dur.ac.uk/~dch0www/Staff/jmh)

code developed by J. Hutson.
