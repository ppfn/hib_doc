eadiab


###   Command EADIAB


------------------------------


The command EADIAB  requests the determination of the adiabatic energies as a function

of  R .  These are defined by Eq. (6) of the help link which summarizes

the  [close coupling](closecoupled.html)   method.


The command line syntax is


EADIAB,{jobname}


where

{jobname}: Â  the jobname under which the wavefunction information

from the previous run is stored, as the file  {jobname}.wfu


![](warningsmall.gif)  In order to create the  {jobname}.wfu  file, the previous run must have

been done with the flags  [WAVEFL](wavefl.html)   and  [AIRYFL](airyfl.html)

both set .TRUE.


The only adiabatic energies which are written out are those which correlate adiabatically

at large R with the internal states of the collision partners whose

rotational angular momenta and

additional indices are specified in the arrays  [JOUT](jout.html)   and

[INDOUT](indout.html)  .  Specifically, adiabatic energies are given for each channel for

which


J(i) = JOUT(i)


and for which the vector element  INDOUT(i)  corresponds to the quantum

number L and the extra index of the desired channel packed into a

single array as follows:


INDOUT(i) = sign[IND(i)] x [100 L(i) + | IND(i) | ]


The asymptotic energy ordering of the internal states can be determined by

running with the flag  [BASTST](bastst.html)   set .TRUE.


![](warningsmall.gif)  The adiabatic energies are determined at all values of  R  lying

between  [RENDLD](rendld.html)   and  [RENDAI](rendld.html)  , with the

grid size and spacing controlled by the same parameters which govern the AIRY integration, namely

[SPAC](spac.html)  ,  [FSTFAC](fstfac.html)  ,  [TOLAI](tolai.html)  , and  [RINCR](tolai.html)  .


![](warningsmall.gif)  Highly localized avoided crossings of the adiabatic

curves often occur.  Use of a fine grid in  R  is the only way to interpret

properly the adiabatic energies in these cases.
