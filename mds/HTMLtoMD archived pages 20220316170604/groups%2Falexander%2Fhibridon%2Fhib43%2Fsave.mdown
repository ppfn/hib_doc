###   Commands SHOW, SAVE, and READ


------------------------------


The command

SHOW


causes the current values of all parameters and flags to

be displayed on the screen and written to the main  [output](output.html)   file


------------------------------


Changes made to the currently accessed input file can be saved using

the command


SAVE


Similarly, the current set of parameters and flags can be saved to a new

file by the command


SAVE={filename}


{filename}  can be lower or upper case, but is converted

internally so that the first character is upper case and all subsequent

characters are lower case.


Initially the default inputfile is named Inpt


The SAVE command is useful for creating updated input data files.


------------------------------


The command

READ

causes all parameters and flags to be reread from the

current input file.


The command

READ,{filename}

causes all parameters and flags to be reread from the

file  {filename} .


This command is useful if you have changed any parameters or flags and wish

to restore a previous set
