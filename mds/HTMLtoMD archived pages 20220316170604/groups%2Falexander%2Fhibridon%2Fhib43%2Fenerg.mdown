###   Energies


------------------------------


The values of the total energy at which the scattering calcuation

will be run are specified by the input line


ENERG = {energy1},{energy2}...{energyN}


If other input data occurs on the same line, then the string of

energies must be terminated by a backslash.


![](warning.gif)  Note that if the length of

the array of energies is greater than the current value of  [NERG](nerg.html)  , then

[NERG](nerg.html)   is reset accordingly.  The maximum number of energies cannot

exceed 25.


------------------------------


If the first energy is negative, then the calculations are to be preformed on a regular grid of

energies, specified by


ENERG = {negative number},{energy1},{energ2},{nerg}


where


-  energy1 :  The initial energy


-  energy2 :  The final energy


-  nerg :  The number of energies (less than or equal to 25)


The spacing for the grid of energies is determined as


delta_e=(energ2-energ1)/nerg


This spacing is then rounded to the nearest 0.01 cm -1 , so that the final energy

becomes


e_final=e_initial + (nerg-1)*delta_e


which may not be exactly equal to the final energy which you initially specified.


------------------------------


In all cases, the energy values are reordered in decreasing order, starting with the

highest value.
