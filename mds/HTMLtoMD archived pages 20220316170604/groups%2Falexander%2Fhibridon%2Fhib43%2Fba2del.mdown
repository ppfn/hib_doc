###   Basis Subroutine

and System Specific Parameters: Collisions between

a  2 Delta Molecule and a Spherical Atom


------------------------------


BASISTYPE = 17


System subroutine:  sy2del


Basis subroutine:  hiba2del.f


Ref.  B. Nizamov, P. J. Dagdigian, Y.-R. Tzeng, and M. H. Alexander,

J. Chem. Phys.  115 , 800 (2001).


------------------------------


The definition of the  integer  system dependent parameters is as follows:

NTERM (the number of potential surfaces involved:  this should be 2

in this case).  This parameter can not be changed


NPAR:  number of lambda-doublet components included

If NPAR = 1,   just  ![](eps12.gif)  = +1 states are included


If NPAR .ne. 1, both  ![](eps12.gif)  = +1 and  ![](eps12.gif)  = - 1 states are included


JMAX:     maximum rotational quantum number


IGU:  inversion symmetry of states included in expansion.


IGU = +1 for  gerade  states


IGU = -1 for  ungerade  states


for heteronuclear molecules IGU should be +1


ISA:  Nuclear permutation symmetry ( s/a  label) of states

included in the expansion.


If the  [flag](flags.html)    [IHOMO](flaghf.html)   is .TRUE.,

then only

s  states will be included if ISA = +1 and only  a  states if

ISA = -1


------------------------------


The definition of the  real  system dependent parameters is as follows:


BROT:    rotational constant


ASO:     spin-orbit constant


P, Q:    lambda-doubling constants


------------------------------


The system dependent input paramaters are as follows:

line 1 :  JMAX, IGU, ISA, NPAR


line 2 :  BROT, ASO, P, Q
