###   Parities and Parameter JLPAR


------------------------------


In the  [CC](closecoupled.html)   formulation, there is no coupling between channels whose

internal wavefunction have opposite total parity.  JLPAR is the parameter

which selects the parity of the channels which are included in a CC calculation.


If JLPAR=+1 or -1, then


for molecules in electronic states of odd multiplicity (integer spin) only

those channels for which


e (-1)   J - S - s + L - Jtot   = JLPAR


are included in the channel basis.  For molecules in electronic states of

even multiplicity (half-integer spin) only those channels for which


e (-1)  J - S - s + L - Jtot -  1/2  = JLPAR


are included in the channel basis.  Here


e  = symmetry index of molecular state in Hund's case (a) (e = +1 or -1)


S   = total spin


s   = 1 for sigma-minus states, 0 otherwise


L   = orbital angular momentum


![](cautionsmall.gif)  In general, in the CC formulation, calculations for both values of JLPAR must be performed to determine integral and/or

differential cross sections.  Setting JLPAR = 0 in a    calculation will ensure that the calculation

is done first for JLPAR = 1, and subsequently for JLPAR = -1.
