###   Command DIFFER


------------------------------


The command DIFFER requests a comparison of two  S  matrices, or of the moduli

of two  S  matrices.  The command line syntax is


differ,{jobnam1},{jobnam2},iprint,ienerg,thresh


where


{jobnam1},{jobnam2}:   Names of the two  S -matrix files to be

compared, the first in the file  {jobnam1}n.smt  and the second in file

{jobnam2}n.smt . Here  n  denotes the value of

the parameter ienerg (see below).  In order to create

these  S -matrix files, you must have carried out the prior

calculation with the flag  [WRSMAT](prsmat.html)   = .TRUE.


iprint:   Controls the amount of output, as follows:


iprint = 0:   Only the values of the average relative and largest

relative differences are printed


iprint = 1:   The values of the average relative, average

absolute, largest relative, and largest absolute

differences are printed


iprint = 2:   All the S-matrix elements are printed followed by the

values of the average relative, average absolute,

largest relative, and largest absolute differences


ienerg:      The cardinal value of the  [energy](energ.html)

to which the  S  matrices refer. If  ienerg = 2 , say, then  the

second energy  S  matrices [ {jobnam1}2.smt  and

{jobnam2}2.smt ] are compared


thresh:   All  S -matrix elements smaller than  thresh

are ignored in the comparison.

If  thresh  is a positive number (or zero), the comparison and the output

involves the  moduli  of the  S -matrix elements. If  thresh  is negative, the

comparison and the output involve both the real and the imaginary parts of

the  S  matrix.


The default values of these variables are:


iprint = 1


ienerg = 1


thresh = 1.E-5


![](warningsmall.gif)  Both  {jobnam1}  and  {jobnam2}  must be specified


------------------------------


As an example, the command


differ,oldjob,newjob,0,2


would request a comparison between the moduli of the  S  matrices in

files  oldjob2.smt  and  newjob2.smt
