###   Command PARTC


------------------------------


The command PARTC allows you to print out a subset of previously

calculated partial cross sections which have been determined and saved

in the file

{jobname}n.pcs .  The subset of partial cross sections which will be printed

to  [file](files.html)    {jobname}n.psc

( note the different extensions ) is specified as follows:


- the rotational quantum number and additional index of the INITIAL state

should be specified in the PARTC command, as described below

- the rotational quantum numbers and additional indices of both the

INITIAL and FINAL states  must  be included in the arrays JOUT and

INDOUT in the initial job used to create the  {jobname}1.pcs  file


The command line syntax is


PARTC,{jobname},JI,INI,ienerg


where

{jobnam}:    the jobname under which the partial cross sections

have been stored as  {jobname}n.pcs .  Here  n  denotes the

value of the parameter ienerg (see below).  Partial

cross section (.pcs) files can be generated by setting

the

WRPART=.true.


JI:     rotational quantum number of initial state


INI:    additional index of initial state


ienerg:     the cardinal value of the  [energy](energ.html)

for which the partial

cross section have been computed.  i.e.  if  ienerg = 2 , then the

second energy partial cross sections  [ {jobname}2.pcs ] are

printed


The default input parameters are:


JOB:             The name of the current job, specified by the  [JOB](files.html)   ={jobname}

command; by default  Job


IENERG:         1
