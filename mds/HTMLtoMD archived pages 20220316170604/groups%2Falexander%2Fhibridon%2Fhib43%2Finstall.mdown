You can obtain a copy of  Hibridon 4.3 as

a   g'zipped tar   [archive](hib43.tar.gz) [](install%20Files/archive.gif)

in binary format (~1 MB)


------------------------------


Prerequisites


- If you are installing on a platform that uses the Intel fortan compiler, make sure that the compiler environment

is properly set up.


- For ifort v. 10, this is explained in the directory  ...intel/fce/{version}/doc/INSTALL.htm#settingup .


Specifically, the

scripts

-  ...intel/fce/{version}/bin/ifortvars.sh(.csh)


-  ...intel/fce/{version}/bin/idbvars.sh(.csh)


should be executed. The "fce" directories contain the 64 bit versions of the compiler.   As can be seen in  [](timing.html)  , the 64 bit code executed ~ 1.5 times faster than

the 32 bit code (invoked by sourceing the "fc" rather than "fce" files).


-

For ifort v. 11 (testing has been done with v. 11.0.064, 11.1.058,  11.1.076, 11.1.089) this is explained in the file   /opt/intel/Compiler/11.1/xxx/Documentation/en_US/documentation_f.htm .


Specifically, the scripts

-   source /opt/intel/Compiler/11.1/xxx/bin/ifortvars.csh intel64


-  source /opt/intel/Compiler/11.1/xxx/bin/ifortvars.sh intel64


should be

executed (by  source'ing  these commands) in your  .profile (.login)  file.


-

For ifort v. 12 (testing has been done with v. 12.0.0) this is explained in the file   /opt/intel/composerxe-2011.0.085/Documentation/en_US/documentation_f.htm .


Specifically, the scripts

-   source /opt/intel/bin/compilervars.csh intel64


-   source /opt/intel/bin/ifortvars.csh intel64


-   source /opt/intel/bin/compilervars.sh intel64


-   source /opt/intel/bin/ifortvars.sh intel64


should be

executed (by  source'ing  these commands) in your  .profile (.login)  file.

-  ![](install%20Files/warningsmall.gif) For Apple OSX 10.5 (Leopard), Hibridon works with version 10.1 of the Intel Compiler under both 32 bit (  .../intel/fc ) and 64 bit (  .../intel/fce ) modes,

as well as with version 11.0 under 64 bit mode.


-  ![](install%20Files/warningsmall.gif) For Apple OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard), Hibridon works with version 10.1 of the Intel Compiler under  32 bit (  .../intel/fc ) mode

as well as with version 11.1 and 12 under 64 bit mode.


- You will need to have a local BLAS and LAPACK library


- If you are planning to use Intel's MKL library, make sure that the required environment variables are properly set,

as explained in the file  userguide.pdf .

- On Apple machines and ifort version 10 or 11 this is located in

/Library/Frameworks/Intel_MKL.framework/Documentation .  If you are using the 64 bit compiler, you should use the 64 bit ( em64t ) MKL libraries, rather than the 32 bit libraries.


- On Apple machines and ifort version 12 this is located in

/opt/intel/composerxe-2011.0.085/Documentation/en_US/documentation_f.htm


- On Intel

Linux platforms, you may have to ask your system administrator where this file is located.


- On Apple Intel platforms running ifort 10.x or 11.x, the command to set the required MKL environment variables is


-  source /opt/intel/Compiler/1X.y/zzz/Frameworks/mkl/tools/environment/mklvarsem64t.csh


- Or, for 32 bit

source /opt/intel/Compiler/11.0/064/Frameworks/mkl/tools/environment/mklvars32.csh


- On Apple Intel platforms running ifort 12.x, the command to set the required MKL environment variables is


-

source /opt/intel/mkl/bin/intel64/mklvars_intel64.csh


- If you are using the Portland Group compiler and planning to use the ACML Library, you may have to ask your system

administrator where the library is located.


------------------------------


After you have obtained the g'zipped archive, follow

these steps:


1. Create a main hibridon directory.  We shall designate this

here as  hib43x , although you can give it any name you want.


2. Move the g'zipped tar archive into this directory


3. Uncompress and unpack the tar archive


gunzip hib4.3.tar.gz |tar xvf -


- The Hibridon  �   hypertext help facility (a copy of the help facility you are reading

here) is contained  in the

directory

hib43x/doc/hib_html.

The initial target file for

your web browser should be


hib43x/doc/hib_html/index.html
------------------------------


- Extend your PATH environmental variable to include the  bin  subdirectory

of your main hibridon directory, that is  hib43x/bin


-  ![](install%20Files/warning.gif)

Read the  [license](license.html)   agreement.  If you  do not accept  all provisions of this agreement,

stop

here   and

destroy the software.  If you  accept  the license

agreement, please read  [](acknow.html) [](install%20Files/linksmall.gif)   the instructions for acknowledgement of the code in any future publications

from your group that use the Hibridon  �   package.


-  cd  to the subdirectory  hib43x/bin .


- Execute the command

makefirst

This creates a number

of local configuration files.


- You will be asked if you accept the license.  Respond

"yes" if you accept, otherwise destroy the software.


- You will also be asked to supply


- The name of your FORTRAN compiler (the install script will suggest a default name, which you can change)


- The name of your C compiler (the install script will suggest a default name, which you can change)


- The path of your BLAS and LAPACK libraries (the install script will suggest a default name, which you can change)


The script  makefirst  will create the file  CONFIG

in your top-level Hibridon directory. You should

inspect this file to make sure you agree with the choice of compilers,

compiler options, and BLAS/LAPACK libraries. Several default  CONFIG  files are supplied

for reference, or in case the  makefirst  script does not execute properly at your installation.


The  makefirst  script will create a  CONFIG  file suitable for either a 64-bit or 32-bit.  This choice will depend on what your default

compiler is (which you can verify by the command  which ifort ).


- Execute the command

hib_makeobj


This compiles all the

hibridon  �   source code and creates the on-line executable  hib43x/bin/hib_help .

The file  hib43x/obj.log  contains a log of the compilation, in case

of failure.  Check this log to search for any compiler errors.


To obtain help at any time you can either


1. Execute the command  hib_help  and follow instructions.


2. Use a Web Browser to read the Hibridon  �   HTML  [help library](http://www.chem.umd.edu/groups/alexander/hibridon/hibhelp.html)  .


3. Test your code by executing the command


hibtest


which runs a series of  [test](tests.html)   calculations.  After the tests are run, the results are saved

in the directory  hib43x/testnew .  All files in this directory should be compared

with the canonical results, which are stored in the directory  hib43x/tests .


- On Apple platforms

this comparison can be done graphically, using Apple's  FileMerge  application, by executing

the command

compare_OSX


- On non-Apple platforms, this comparison can be done by excuting the command

compare.com


The comparison between the files in  ../tests  and those in  ../testnew  should agree to within at least 6 significant figures.


- You are now ready to  [link](linking.html)   and  [run](run.html)   your

own code for your particular scattering problem.  Use one of the
------------------------------


potential subroutines in the directory  hib43x/src/pot  as a guide for writing

your own.  You will certainly find it helpful to consult the  [Basis](basis.html)   and

[Systems](system.html)   help files.


- You can run several timing benchmarks by the command  hib_timer  and compare with the results obtained on other platforms

(as discussed in more detail on the  [benchmark](timing.html)   page).


-  Good luck!

all bugs that you may find.  They will  (hopefully) be eliminated in a timely

manner.
