mrcrs


###   Command MRCRS


------------------------------


The command MRCRS allows you to calculate the  m -state resolved  cross sections

defined by Eqs. (14) and (28) of B. Follmeg, P. Rosmus, and H.-J. Werner,

J. Chem. Phys.  93 , 4687 (1990).  The command line is


MRCRS,JOB,IENERG


where the input parameters are:


JOB,IENERG Â   The program searches for  previous calculated tensor cross

sections in the file

Job{ienerg}.tcb , where IENERG is an integer

(IENERG = 1, 2, ... etc.)


The MRCRS command must have been preceded by the command  [TENXSC](tenxsc.html)  , which

creates the table of tensor cross sections used.

m -state resolved cross sections for a transition from rotational level J to J'

will be correct only if the parameter  KMAX  in the TENXSC command is


KMAX .ge. J+J'


MRCRS invokes the calculation of the  m -state resolved cross

sections appropriate to a Legendre expansion of a cylindrically

symmetric  distribution of the relative velocity vectors with respect to

the  z -axis. Here too, the calculated  Legendre terms will be correct only

for values of  ![](lambda12.gif)  (the Legendre index) which are  .le.  the parameter

LAMMAX  in the previous invocation of TENXSC.


The calculated  m -state resolved cross sections are printed out to the

[file](files.html)    Job{ienerg}.mcs  as well as to the standard output
