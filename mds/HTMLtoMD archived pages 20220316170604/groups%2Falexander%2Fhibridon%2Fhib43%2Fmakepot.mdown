###   Testing your potential subroutine (the  makepot  command)


------------------------------


To test your  [potential subroutine](potlist.html)   you must execute the command


makepot {potname}


where

{potname}  is the name of the  [potential](potlist.html)   subroutine  pot_{potname}.f , which

describes the system under investigation and which must be located in the Hibridon subdirectory  src/pot


the  makepot  command creates an executable module  bin/progs/runpot_{potname}_kmax .


The  file  p_{potname}.log  contains a log of this link, which may be examined in

case of failure.


------------------------------
For example,


makepot arno_ccsdt


will create an executable module  bin/progs/runpot_arno_ccsdt


Here is the terminal output from this command


/Users/mha/hib43/bin/progs  makepot arno_ccsdt


making fortran converter ...


running fortran converter ...


compiling runpot.f ...


linking runpot_arno_ccsdt


successful link; moving runpot_arno_ccsdt to ../bin/progs ...


examine /Users/mha/hib43/p_arno_ccsdt.log for diagnostic and/or error messages


Running the resulting executable code  runpot_{potname}  will allow you to print out the expansion coefficients

of the potential at various values of  R , as controlled in the subroutine "driver" in the file  ../src/pot/{potname}.f .


For example, for the arno_ccsdt potential subroutine created as described above


/Users/mha/hib43/bin/progs  runpot_arno_ccsdt
