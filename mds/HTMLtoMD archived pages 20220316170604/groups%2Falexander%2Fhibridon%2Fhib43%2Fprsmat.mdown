###   Flags PRSMAT and WRSMAT


------------------------------


If PRSMAT = .TRUE., then the real and the imaginary  S -matrix elements

will be printed out at the end of the regular output file. To print the

S  matrix to a separate file, set the flag WRSMAT = .TRUE.


![](warningsmall.gif)   S  matrices can be quite large, so be wary of setting

PRSMAT = .TRUE.


------------------------------


If WRSMAT = .TRUE., then selected (or all)  S  matrix elements will be printed out to a

separate file  {jobname}n.smt , where  n  designates the value of the energy,

e.g.  at the first energy the  S -matrix elements will be in the file

{jobname}n.smt , etc.  The subset of  S -matrix matrix elements which

will be printed are defined by the set

of rotational quantum numbers contained in the array  [JOUT](jout.html)

as follows:


If NNOUT is  positive , then the only  S -matrix elements which will be saved

are those for which BOTH the initial and final rotational quantum numbers

correspond to one of the value in the array  [JOUT](jout.html)


If NNOUT is  negative , any column of the  S  matrix for which the initial

rotational quantum number is included in the array  [JOUT](jout.html)   will be printed


------------------------------


The  [command](commands.html)    [PRINTS](prints.html)   allows the

printing of an  S  matrix which has been previously written to the file

{jobname}n.smt .
