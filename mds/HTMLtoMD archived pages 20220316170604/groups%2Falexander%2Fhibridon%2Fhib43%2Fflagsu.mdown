###   Collisions with Surfaces


------------------------------


To treat collisions of a molecule with a surface set FLAGSU = .TRUE.  In

this case the squares of both the off-diagonal as well as the diagonal

elements of the  T  matrix are equal to the squares of the corresponding

S  matrix elements.  FLAGSU should be set .FALSE. for all gas-phase problems.


For collisions of molecules with surfaces, the orbital angular momentum is

zero, and does not couple with the molecular rotational angular momentum.

Thus, if FLAGSU = .TRUE., you must also set  [CSFLAG](csflag.html)   = .TRUE.,

[JTOT1](jtot1.html)   = 0,

and  [JTOT2](jtot1.html)   = 0.  Otherwise the program will abort with a diagnostic message.


For a good reference to the theory of inelastic collisions of a molecule with a flat,

rigid surface see:
