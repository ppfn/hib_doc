###   Command TENXSC


------------------------------


The command TENXSC allows you to calculate the tensor cross sections

defined by Eqs. (30) and (31) of B. Follmeg, P. Rosmus, and H.-J. Werner,

J. Chem. Phys.  93 , 4687 (1990).  The command line is


TENXSC,JOB,IENERG,IFRAME,LAMMAX,KMAX,IN1,IN2,JTOTMX,JMIN,JMAX


where the input parameters are:


JOB,IENERG    The program searches for an S-matrix in the file

Job{ienerg}.smt , where IENERG is an integer

(IENERG = 1, 2, ... etc.)


- The default values of JOB is  JOB  and of INERG is 1


IFRAME      This parameter defines the quantization frame employed in the tensor cross

section calculations (angle-integrated cross sections, except where indicated otherwise below).

IFRAME=0:   The quantization axis is defined as the laboratory Z-axis, with an

isotropic relative velocity distribution.


IFRAME=1:   The quantization axis lies along the initial relative velocity vector (collision frame).


IFRAME=2:   The initial level has quantization axis along the initial relative velocity vector, and the

final level has quantization axis along the final velocity vector (helicity frame).  In this case,  m -resolved

differential cross sections are computed over a grid of scattering angles (0.5 deg spacing) for the ( J1MIN,IN1 ) -

J1MIN,IN1 ) elastic transition, and then differential tensor cross sections are computed.  The differential tensor

cross sections are numerically integrated to determine integral tensor cross sections.


LAMMAX         The maximum value of the anisotropic term in the velocity

distribution (lower case lambda in the above article).

Tensor cross sections for all  even  values of lambda

from 0 to LAMMAX are calculated.  ![](warningsmall.gif)

At present only LAMMAX=0 is operational!


KMAX         The maximum value of the multipole order for which tensor cross

sections are calculated.  Cross sections for all values of  K i   and

K f   .le. KMAX are calculated.


IN1,IN2        The initial and final values of the additional index


JTOTMX         The maximum value included in the summation over total

angular momentum (upper case  J  in Eqs. 30 and 31 of the

above article)


JMIN,JMAX     Tensor cross sections are computed for all values of the

molecular rotational quantum number (lower case  j i   and

j f

in Eqs. 30 and 31 of the above article) ranging from JMIN

to JMAX.


To determine the  S -matrix elements required by the command TENXSC, you

must carry out a prior calculation with

the flag   [WRSMAT](prsmat.html)   = .true.


JMIN ... JMAX  included in the array  [JOUT](jout.html)


IN1  and  IN2  included in the array  [INDOUT](indout.html)
