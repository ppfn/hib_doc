###   Parameters TOLAI and RINCR


------------------------------


The key parameters TOLAI and RINCR control the interval size in the AIRY propagation.


Whenever  R   no  change is allowed in the interval size.


If, however,  R    RINCR and

TOLAI is .ge. 1, then the width of the next interval is set to be a

constant multiple of the present interval size, namely


DRNOW(n+1) = DRNOW(n) * TOLAI


Thus, to ensure constant step sizes in the AIRY propagation, set TOLAI = 1.

By setting TOLAI   1, the interval sizes will be monotonically

increasing, so that you will use larger step sizes at long range, where the

potential presumably varies more slowly.  Values of TOLAI in the range

1.1 - 1.3 are appropriate for in most

calculations.


If, however, the control parameter TOLAI is set to be  only  if

R    RINCR,  the

interval sizes are adjusted using crude estimates of the error intoduced by

the linear approximation to the  W  matrix (see M. H. Alexander, J. Chem. Phys.  81 ,

4510).  These estimates are

designated COFF and CDIAG.  The width of the next interval is adjusted

according to the following alogrithm:


DRNOW(n+1) = DRNOW(n) * (TOLAI/CMAX) ** (1/3)


where  CMAX=max(COFF,CDIAG) . If CMAX   TOLAI, the interval width is decreased.


In this case (TOLAI  S  matrix.


The default value is TOLAI=1, which forces constant interval sizes in the AIRY propagation.
