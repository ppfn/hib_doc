readpt


###   Flag READPT


------------------------------


If  READPT = .TRUE. , then the  [potential](potlist.html)   subroutine is expecting to

read data stored in a file whose name is given on the last line of

the  [input](input.html)   data file.


If READPT = .FALSE., then the last line of the INPUT data file is

ignored.
